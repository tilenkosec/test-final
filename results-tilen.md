# Results --- Tilen `55%`

#### Import (manually typing is OK) [recent results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavaliers%E2%80%93Warriors_rivalry#Results_(2014%E2%80%9315_season%E2%80%93present)) into suitable data structure. Use games from 1-26.
These results will be used as a learning set for our predictions.

**Correct results** `50/50%`

**Style** `0/30%`

Overcomplicated by using external (.csv) data source. When using program one must manually type the
correct path for the file. Using two arrays would much simpler solution.

**Code readability** `20/20%`


**Surprise me** `0/10%` (bonus)

#### Let's make some statistics first:

 -Print out, how many times Golden State and Cleveland won overall.

Number Of wins for Cleveland:  12 (actually 9)
Number Of wins for Oakland:  14 (actually 17)

 -Print out, how many times each team won at home and away.

 -Average points scored by each team.

 -Trend, which team is better lately? (feel free to find a way how to do it)

 no output

**Correct results** `25/50%`

**Style** `5/30%`

From 35-60 code duplicates. Use functions. City_winner is manually typed from data, which is something
program should do from original data.

**Code readability** `15/20%`

#### Create an algorithm that will print out the prediction for the next game. Use games 27 and 28 to test the predictions. The result should be logical (e.g. 32:18, or 174:198 don't make sense.)

 -There will be min 2 and max 3 more games until the deadline. Test your predictions against these matches too by including games 27 and 28 into learning set. Are predictions any better?

No comments describing how it works.

#### Run your algorithm 10 000 times and print out, what is average prediction.

**Correct results** `50/50%`

#### Create a betting system where user will input their prediction only once.

*{Use games 29,30,(31) as actual results}*

 -Print out the user's prediction

 -Print out the prediction your program calculated.

Not printed

 Check the actual result and test your program and user's prediction:

 -If winner is correctly predicted, award is 10€.

 -If winner is correctly predicted and points of one team are missed by less than 8%, award is additional 15€.
 **or**
 -If winner is correctly predicted and points of both teams are missed by less than 8%, award is additional 40€

 -If result of one team is totally correct, award is additional 100€.
 **or**
 -If result of the game is totally correct, award is additional 500€.

**Correct results** `10/50%`

**Style** `5/30%`
No use of program result prediction.

**Code readability** `5/20%`

Hardly readable code, no comments.

#### Criteria
 `0% - 49%` : Didn't pass.

 `50% - 64%`: **Talk about the test solution, if there is insufficient knowledge about solved test, didn't pass.**

 `65% - 100%`: Passed

 `101% - 110%`: Passed and you get a 6pack of some good beer. Choose dark or light :)
