# Results --- Tilen `55%`



`(7/10%)`
#### Import (manually typing is OK) [recent results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavaliers%E2%80%93Warriors_rivalry#Results_(2014%E2%80%9315_season%E2%80%93present)) into suitable data structure. Use games from 1-26.
These results will be used as a learning set for our predictions.

**Correct results** `50/50%`

**Style** `0/30%`

Overcomplicated by using external (.csv) data source. When using program one must manually type the
correct path for the file. Using two arrays would much simpler solution.

**Code readability** `20/20%`


**Surprise me** `0/10%` (bonus)

#### Let's make some statistics first:

 -Print out, how many times Golden State and Cleveland won overall.

Number Of wins for Cleveland:  12 (actually 9)
Number Of wins for Oakland:  14 (actually 17)

 -Print out, how many times each team won at home and away.

 -Average points scored by each team.

 -Trend, which team is better lately? (feel free to find a way how to do it)

 no output

**Correct results** `25/50%`

**Style** `5/30%`

From 35-60 code duplicates. Use functions. City_winner is manually typed from data, which is something
program should do from original data.

**Code readability** `15/20%`

#### Create an algorithm that will print out the prediction for the next game. Use games 27 and 28 to test the predictions. The result should be logical (e.g. 32:18, or 174:198 don't make sense.)

 -There will be min 2 and max 3 more games until the deadline. Test your predictions against these matches too by including games 27 and 28 into learning set. Are predictions any better?

ran_2 and ran_4 are not used.

**Code readability** `0/20%`

No comments describing how it works.

#### Run your algorithm 10 000 times and print out, what is average prediction.

**Correct results** `50/50%`

#### Create a betting system where user will input their prediction only once.

*{Use games 29,30,(31) as actual results}*

 -Print out the user's prediction

 -Print out the prediction your program calculated.

Not printed

 Check the actual result and test your program and user's prediction:

 -If winner is correctly predicted, award is 10€.

 -If winner is correctly predicted and points of one team are missed by less than 8%, award is additional 15€.
 **or**
 -If winner is correctly predicted and points of both teams are missed by less than 8%, award is additional 40€

 -If result of one team is totally correct, award is additional 100€.
 **or**
 -If result of the game is totally correct, award is additional 500€.

**Correct results** `10/50%`

**Style** `5/30%`
No use of program result prediction.

**Code readability** `5/20%`

Hardly readable code, no comments.

#### Criteria
 `0% - 49%` : Didn't pass.

 `50% - 64%`: Talk about the test solution, if there is insufficient knowledge about solved test, didn't pass.
